# Set up the environment (not actually necessary if you have a different workflow) 
- Install `python3`, probably a version since `3.6` 
Run: (set up new virtual environment by telling `venv`, a Python module, to create a new environment at `./venv`
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies (this is the part that matters)

```bash
pip install ipython jupyter ipython numpy
```
